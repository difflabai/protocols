# Protocols

This repository contains open standards and protocols for AI development, maintained by [Differential AI Lab](https://difflab.ai).

### [`.project/`](/docs/projects)

A vendor-neutral directory structure for AI project context — instructions, memory, conversations, files, tasks, agents, and more — in a portable, markdown-first format that works across Claude, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini, and other AI tools.

---

Each protocol is documented with its specification, rationale, and implementation guidance. Use the sidebar to navigate between them.
