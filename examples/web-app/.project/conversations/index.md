# Conversations

This directory archives notable AI-assisted development sessions. Each
conversation includes a summary in its frontmatter for quick scanning and
the full transcript in the body.

Conversations are stored in markdown format by default. The frontmatter
summary is designed for Tier 1 catalog discovery so tools can determine
relevance without loading the full transcript.
