# Memory

This directory stores persistent knowledge about the TaskFlow project. Memory
is descriptive (capturing what is and what was decided) rather than prescriptive
(that belongs in instructions/).

## Contents

- **decisions.md** -- Architectural decision records explaining why key technical
  choices were made.
- **entities/team.md** -- Team member profiles, roles, and areas of expertise.
