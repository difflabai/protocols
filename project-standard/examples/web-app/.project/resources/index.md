# Resources

This directory catalogs external systems and references that are part of the
TaskFlow project ecosystem. Unlike context files, resources are not fetched
or loaded into AI sessions. They exist so that AI tools are aware of the
broader project environment.

Each resource file includes a summary of what the resource is and notes on
how to work with it.

## Available Resources

- **staging-environment.md** -- Staging deployment for pre-production testing.
- **design-system.md** -- Figma design system with components and tokens.
- **ci-pipeline.md** -- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline configuration.
